To begin with, this already works.
You can pull the repository and, if you use a UNIX-like OS you should be able
to check out the first results by hitting "./run"
Or just compile "calculator.c" and execute it.

The code is a bit dirty, because I was fiddling with the algorithm of parsing
and evaluating a mathematical expression.
I'm going to clean it up very soon and also add brackets parsing.

The calculator is based on the Shunting Yard algorithm, but it doesn't turn
infix notation into Reverse Polish Notation (as that's often the case).
But see for yourself and be free to comment on how bad or good I wrote
the calculator.

NOTE: This is not a professional project, rather an educational project

I don't even know how much functionality this program should have, so let's
just wait for it.


Problems and Bugs:
- All equally-important operators associate only from left to right (wrong for exponentials)
- 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 == 2 ^ (3 ^ 4) <- that is the right answer.
- TODO: provide a choice for right or left association
